## 📘 Overview  
This project demonstrates the **design and implementation of a modern SQL-based Data Warehouse** and Analytics solution.  
It integrates **ERP, CRM, and Excel data sources** into a centralized **data warehouse** through an **ETL pipeline**, enabling clean, structured, and business-ready data for **reporting and analytics**.

---

## 🚀 Epics & Tasks  

### **Epic 1: Analyze Requirements**  
- Collaborated with stakeholders to gather data and reporting needs.  
- Planned and implemented a **modern Data Warehouse** using **SQL Server**.

### **Epic 2: Design Data Architecture**  
- Evaluated four modern architectures:  
  - **Data Warehouse**, **Data Lake**, **Data Lakehouse**, and **Data Mesh**.  
- Selected **Medallion Architecture** for simplicity and scalability:  
  - **Bronze Layer** → Raw source data (traceability & debugging).  
  - **Silver Layer** → Cleaned & standardized data (ready for analytics).  
  - **Gold Layer** → Business-ready views for reporting & BI.

## 🧱 Architecture Layers  

| Layer | Description | Target Users |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **Bronze** | Raw, unprocessed data directly from source. No transformation. | Data Engineers |
| **Silver** | Cleaned, standardized, and enriched data. | Data Engineers, Analysts |
| **Gold** | Aggregated, business-ready views for dashboards & analytics. | Analysts, Business Users |

---

## 🧩 Design Highlights  
- **ETL Pipelines**: Load, clean, and transform data from ERP, CRM, and Excel.  
- **Data Modeling**: Implemented **Star Schema** in Gold Layer.  
- **Naming Conventions**:  
  - Use lowercase & English words.  
  - Bronze/Silver tables: `src_<system>_<table>`  

  - Gold layer: business-oriented names like `fact_sales`, `agg_customers`.  
- **Tools Used**: SQL Server, Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Power BI, Git.

## 🏗️ Data Warehouse Architecture

![Data Warehouse Architecture_Pro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/516eac6c-7afe-4a51-b987-c0739ab5b637)

### 🔹 Overview
This architecture follows the **Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold)** pattern, a best practice in modern data engineering.  
It organizes data processing into layers, ensuring better data quality, scalability, and usability for analytics.

---

### 🟤 Bronze Layer — Raw Data
- **Source:** CRM, ERP, or CSV files  
- **Purpose:** Store unprocessed, raw data from multiple sources.  
- **Object Type:** Tables  
- **Load Method:** Batch process using *Full Load (Truncate & Insert)*  
- **Goal:** Preserve original data for traceability and reprocessing.

---

### ⚪ Silver Layer — Clean & Standardized Data
- **Purpose:** Transform, clean, and standardize raw data into a consistent format.  
- **Object Type:** Tables  
- **Load Method:** Batch process using *Full Load (Truncate & Insert)*  
- **Goal:** Create a single source of truth that ensures data integrity and quality.

---

### 🟡 Gold Layer — Business-Ready Data
- **Purpose:** Deliver analytics-ready datasets for BI, reporting, and ML use cases.  
- **Object Type:** Views  
- **Load Method:** No physical loads (data served from views)  
- **Goal:** Provide curated, aggregated, and business-friendly data models.

---

### 📊 Consumers
The **Gold Layer** data is consumed by:
- **BI Reporting Tools** – e.g., Power BI, Tableau  
- **Ad-hoc SQL Queries** – For data exploration and validation  
- **Machine Learning Pipelines** – For predictive analytics and automation  

---

### 🚀 Benefits
- Clear separation of data transformation stages  
- Easier maintenance and auditing  
- Improved data quality and reusability  
- Scalable foundation for advanced analytics

---

💡 *This modular architecture makes data management more efficient and analytics more reliable.*
